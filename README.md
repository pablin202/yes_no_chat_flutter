# Yes/No Chat App

## Description
This is a basic chat application built using Dart and Flutter. The main objective of this project is to showcase the usage of basic Flutter libraries and concepts. The app allows users to ask questions, and it responds with a simple "yes" or "no" answer, accompanied by a GIF before each response.

## Features
- Simple chat interface for asking questions
- Automatic responses with "yes" or "no"
- GIFs accompanying each response

## Technologies and Libraries Used
The following technologies and libraries are utilized in this application:

### Dart and Flutter
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/): A programming language used to build Flutter applications.
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): An open-source UI framework used to create beautiful and natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### State Management
- [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider): A state management library in Flutter that allows easy sharing of data between different parts of the application.

### Mappers
- Mappers: Custom mapping functions used to transform data between different formats or structures.

### HTTP Requests
- [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio): A powerful HTTP client library for Dart and Flutter, used for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

### Packages
- Various Flutter packages: The project utilizes various Flutter packages to enhance functionality and simplify development.

### Callback Functions
- Functions returning values as callbacks: The application uses callback functions to handle responses and perform actions based on user input.

### Scroll
- Scroll: Flutter provides built-in scrolling widgets and features to handle scrollable content.
